# DC-to-DC-Buck-Conveter
This repository shows the stage-by-stage design of a DC-DC Buck converter that includes a PWM controller, gate driver, and compensator.

Brief description of filesin the repository:
1) Draft1.asc - Buck converter including PWM controller and gate driver for transient simulation.
2) Draft2.asc - AC analysis of linearized buck converter and for observing Bode plot.
3) Draft3.asc - Standalone compensator design for AC analysis to find the gain and phase margins.
4) Draft4.asc - Full Buck converter design with all the different stages forming a closed loop system.
